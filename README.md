# Factors-Influencing-Loan-Approval-Default-A-Bayesian-Approach

This project applies Bayesian logistic regression to predict loan approval and default risk using historical applicant data. The analysis explores the relationship between financial and demographic features—such as annual income, credit score, loan amount, asset values, education level, and employment type—and loan status outcomes. The workflow includes:

 - Data Collection & Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing loan datasets, handling missing values, and exploring data distribution.

 - Exploratory Data Analysis – Identifying key trends, correlations, and feature importance.

 - Bayesian Modeling – Implementing Bayesian logistic regression to incorporate prior knowledge, quantify uncertainty, and improve interpretability.

 - Prior Sensitivity Analysis – Assessing the effect of different prior choices on model performance.

 - Model Evaluation – Using convergence diagnostics and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) to validate model stability and predictive accuracy.

 - Results & Visualizations – Presenting findings through clear visualizations and performance metrics to highlight influential factors.

This approach provides a robust, probabilistic framework for risk-sensitive decision-making, enabling lenders to make fairer, more reliable loan approval decisions while minimizing default risk.
